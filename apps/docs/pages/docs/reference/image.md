title: React Image Component for Astro
---

By default, the import of Astro image components create Astro component.

You can't use them in another Jsx Runtime such as React

To overcome that we created
the [React Image component on top of Astro service](https://github.com/gerardnico/interact-astro/blob/main/packages/interact-astro/src/components/Image/Image.tsx)
