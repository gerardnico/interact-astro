# Generated

Favicons may be generated from a master svg file with the command [generate-favicons](../../../packages/interact/src/cli/commands/generate-favicon.ts)
They are added automatically in the favicon set if the generated set is found on the file system
in the `public` directory.

List:
* favicon.ico
* favicon-96x96.png
* favicon.svg
* apple-touch-icon.png
